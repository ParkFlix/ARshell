Include ARshell.jar to the libs of your projects, 2. Add a permission to the AndroidManifest.xml: , 3. Add 5 lines of code to get ARshell working: i) Instantiation: ARshell as = new ARshell();, ii) Initialise ARshell with an interval of recognition: as.init(this, 10);, iii) Start recognition: as.start(this);, iv) Get the recognition result wherever you want: Result.getNameFromType(Result.getActivity()), v) Stop recognition: as.stop(this);.\r\n\r\nPlease do not forget to ref our paper: Mingyang Zhong, Jiahui Wen, Peizhao Hu, Jadwiga Indulska, Advancing Android Activity Recognition Service with Markov Smoother, PerCom workshop, 2015.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
